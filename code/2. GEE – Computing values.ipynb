    "In this notebook, we will use Python to query Google Earth Engine and compute the share of each city outline that is covered by trees. The same will be done for each hexagon.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the process, we will be using the city outlines that we computed earlier and two raster datasets that display the height of the tree canopy in the entire planet, allowing us to look only at vegetation with more than 1m of height.\n",
    "\n",
    "The [first](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41559-023-02206-6) was made by researchers from four universities: ETH Zurich, Yale University, University of Copenhagen and University of Zurich (_Lang, N. et. al._) It has a 10m resolution.\n",
    "\n",
    "It was combined with [another one](https://sustainability.atmeta.com/blog/2024/04/22/using-artificial-intelligence-to-map-the-earths-forests/), by researchers at Meta and the World Resources Institute, with a finer 1m resolution.\n",
    "\n",
    "We decided to combine both to reduce the incidence of false positives, which we detected on both datasets upon manual inspection of selected cities. \n",
    "\n",
    "The first datasetn detected trees in the waves formed on the surface of urban bodys of water, such as lagoons and havens. This happened, for example, in Lagos (Nigeria).\n",
    "\n",
    "Meta's model often detected trees in high-density urban developments in places like São Paulo (Brazil) and New Delhi (India).\n",
    "\n",
    "Another caveat is that the datasets don't show all the trees that exist at the same moment of time. They use a mosaic of satellite imagery taken at different times. The first dataset spans the year 2020, while the later mostly consists of images taken from 2018 to 2020."
